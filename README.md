Just practice putting together a simple web app. The Front-end uses Bootstrap and the Back-end uses Mongo + Mongoose for the database, Cloudify for image upload and display, Passport for security, and Express plus a variety of different libraries & API's (Body Parser, View EJS, Method Override, Connect Flash, Google Maps, Weather, etc, etc) for different features.
